	  Select this option to enable the legacy stpio interface. No

config STM_COPROCESSOR_CLASS
	tristate "STMicroelectronics coprocessor support"
	select FW_LOADER
	select BPA2
	select LIBELF_32
	---help---
	  Many of the ST system-on-chip devices have multiple CPUs, where a
	  master CPU running Linux has control over a number of slave CPUs,
	  which are usually used to run dedicated algorithms.
	  Enabling this option will add support to the Linux kernel to
	  control these slave CPUs, reserve memory for them, and thus allow
	  code to be downloaded onto them and executed.

	  Memory allocation is managed through BPA2 so, to define a
	  coprocessor's memory size and address, use the normal BPA2
	  command line option:
	    bpa2_parts=<name0>:<size0>:<address0>,<name1>:<size1>:<address1>,...
	  where:
	    <nameX> is "coproc_" followed by the coprocessor name, for example
	    "audio0".
	    <sizeX> defines the size of the partition
	    <addressX> defines the base address of memory reserved for the
	    coprocessor application code and data.

	  For example:
	    bpa2_parts=coproc_video0:16m:0x06000000,coproc_audio0:16m:0x07000000

	  As with all other BPA2 addresses, addresses are physical addresses,
	  and so may appear at different virtual addresses when mapped into the
	  CPU's memory map.

        ---help---
          Enable this option to print out information about the slave CPUs
          addresses and operations you are using for coprocessor.

config STM_RNG
       bool "STM Random Number Generator Support"
       default y
       ---help---
         This option adds support for the hardware Random Number Generator
         (RNG) present on different STMicroelectronics SoCs.  It allows the
         RNG to feed /dev/random with entropy thereby ensuring real
         random numbers from this device.

         Without this option, /dev/random has little entropy and is not
         useful.  In fact, it may block for a long time while waiting for
         entropy.

         This option should always be enabled for relevant SoCs.

         This option can be used in conjunction with the /dev/hw_random
         driver found in the char drivers menu.

config  STM_MALI_MEM_SHARED
        bool "Mali memory model: shared"
	default y
	---help---
	  This resource configures the driver to obtain graphics
	  memory from OS.
	  This has the advantage that there is no requirement for memory to be
	  specifically reserved for the Mali GPU.
	  This is always enabled to have Mali GPU working fine with at least
	  the OS memory usage.

config STM_MALI_MEM_SIZE
	hex "Mali memory size"
	depends on STM_MALI_MEM_SHARED
	default "0x0E000000"
	---help---
	  Specify the size of memory which the Mali driver is allowed to
	  allocate from Linux kernel.
	  If you choice the shared memory model this size value rappresents the
	  maximum limit of memory the OS can assign to the Mali GPU.

config	STM_MALI_MEM_DEDICATED
	bool "Mali memory model: dedicated"
	default n
	select BPA2
	---help---
	  Use this resource to configure dedicated areas of memory that are used
	  exclusively by the Mali GPU. You must not share this memory with
	  any other device or memory allocator.
	  The memory allocator privileges this than the shared.
	  Only when the dedicated memory will finish the allocator will use
	  the shared.

	  The driver will retreive base address and size from a BPA2 partition
	  called: mali-memory:base:size

	  bpa2parts=mali-memory:192M:0x40000000

	  If unsure don't use this but the shared memory model.
