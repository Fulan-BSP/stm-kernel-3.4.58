config STPIO
	bool "Legacy stpio API"
	default n
	help
	  Select this option to enable the legacy stpio interface. No
	  code within the kernel uses this API, it is retained only for
	  drivers outside the kernel which might still need it.

config STM_DMA
	bool "STMicroelectronics DMA API"
	select SH_DMA_API
	select LIBELF_32
	default y
	---help---
	  Selecting this option will provide support for STMicroelectronics'
	  custom DMA API. This API provides support for data transfers of
	  various dimensions and complex linked list operations. In addition
	  to these free-running operations it also allows management of the
	  paced-transfer peripherals on recent STM parts.

	  If you have a device from STMicroelectronics, then say Y here.
	  Otherwise say N.

config STM_COPROCESSOR_CLASS
	tristate "STMicroelectronics coprocessor support"
	select FW_LOADER
	select BPA2
	select LIBELF
	---help---
	  Many of the ST system-on-chip devices have multiple CPUs, where a
	  master CPU running Linux has control over a number of slave CPUs,
	  which are usually used to run dedicated algorithms.
	  Enabling this option will add support to the Linux kernel to
	  control these slave CPUs, reserve memory for them, and thus allow
	  code to be downloaded onto them and executed.

	  Memory allocation is managed through BPA2 so, to define a
	  coprocessor's memory size and address, use the normal BPA2
	  command line option:
	    bpa2_parts=<name0>:<size0>:<address0>,<name1>:<size1>:<address1>,...
	  where:
	    <nameX> is "coproc_" followed by the coprocessor name, for example
	    "audio0".
	    <sizeX> defines the size of the partition
	    <addressX> defines the base address of memory reserved for the
	    coprocessor application code and data.

	  For example:
	    bpa2_parts=coproc_video0:16m:0x06000000,coproc_audio0:16m:0x07000000

	  As with all other BPA2 addresses, addresses are physical addresses,
	  and so may appear at different virtual addresses when mapped into the
	  CPU's memory map.

config STM_COPROCESSOR_ST40
	tristate "ST40 coprocessor support"
	depends on STM_COPROCESSOR_CLASS
	---help---
	  Provide support for ST40 coprocessor hardware.

config STM_COPROCESSOR_ST200

        ---help---
          Enable this option to print out information about the slave CPUs
          addresses and operations you are using for coprocessor.

config STM_RNG
       bool "STM Random Number Generator Support"
       default y
       ---help---
         This option adds support for the hardware Random Number Generator
         (RNG) present on different STMicroelectronics SoCs.  It allows the
         RNG to feed /dev/random with entropy thereby ensuring real
         random numbers from this device.

         Without this option, /dev/random has little entropy and is not
         useful.  In fact, it may block for a long time while waiting for
         entropy.

         This option should always be enabled for relevant SoCs.

         This option can be used in conjunction with the /dev/hw_random
         driver found in the char drivers menu.

config STM_MALI_DEBUG

config PMS
	bool "Power Management Scheme"
	default n
	depends on PM
	select PM_RUNTIME
	help
	  This option enables the STMicroelectronics Power Management
	  Scheme (PMS).

	  This is a kernel framework based around power profiles (pms_state),
	  where the designer can specify devices power states and the
	  clock frequency rates.
	  Moving the system between pms_states the user application can
	  tune the power consumption according with what the system is doing.

config PMS_CHECK_GROUP
	bool "PMS always checks the state group"
	depends on PMS
	default n
	help
	  Enable this option if the state group has to be controlled.
	  When a group of pms_states are enabled in the same time, this option
	  forces the PMS to check that there is no conflict inside the group
	  itself. In case of conflict the group is rejected.

config PMS_DEBUG
	bool "PMS debug"
	default n
	depends on PMS
	help
	  Enable this option to print out information about the PMS
